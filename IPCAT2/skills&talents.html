                                <p>Well drum roll please… So just to mention a few.<br>
                                    As I’d mentioned earlier, my love for computers gave me an interest in whats about them this in turn helped me nurture my skill in coding. I’ve actually majored in it here in Uni. Therefore, coding or programming is a skill I posses and the ability to problem solve. It takes a lot to write all those lines of code, then realize there’s a bug, you’d be this close from losing it, but it is worth it when it all comes together.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I can say, I can put pen on paper and sketch something that’s nice to look art. Therefore, I can say artistry or drawing is both a talent and a skill. A personal interest in painting and sketching inspired by the famous Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, I wanted to bring art to life. I remember I would doodle small drawings on my books and textbooks. It’s been a minute since I did a piece, that should change ASAP.<br>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My family is made up of vocally enabled individuals or ‘songers’ as we call each other, don’t think about it too much, its an inside joke. Anyway, for that matter singing and listening to music have been part and parcel of my upbringing and I cherish it so dearly. I remember a time I sang in high school, the expressions of my classmates were priceless. <br>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    I almost drowned after my dad and brother realized I was a ‘pool walker’. I had to learn how to swim. My brother was literally a fish in water, which was really cool. So, I started learning, baby steps, up to where I am at now. Pools are actually more fun when you actually KNOW how to use them. So swimming is something I enjoy doing, for leisure, I didn’t make the team in time, but oh well nothing is lost.
