                        <p>Of course, as children, we all looked up to our parents like they had superhuman abilities as we awed to every action that seemed impossible to us. I happened to have the strongest, the fastest, the smartest and the most invincible of them, almost thought they could fly, waited long enough to realize they couldnâ€™t. What a disappointment! But they are still my heroes. Hardworking, caring and loving.<br>
                            As a child I was very adventurous. Do you have any idea how cool it is to hear stories about your younger self being a mini James Bond? Mind blowing. I loved nature but nature seemed not to like me that much since I pretty much got a scar for every time I went past the door. Of course, there comes a time in every childâ€™s life when they make mistakes and have to be put in their place, if you know what I mean. But I regret nothing as those were some of the best memories I made.<br>
                            Well of course I had friends, lots of friends, since well, I was James Bond. Out of all of them was Griffins, from Griffindorâ€¦ no just joking, I was a Harry Porter fan, he was my favorite. Donâ€™t judge, we all have favorites. Anyway, he was my adventure sidekick as we sought to explore the great outdoors and play football with a custom handmade ball. We were living the life! Nostalgic.<br>
                            And then there was school, uuurgh, it was fun though, during playtime. I donâ€™t know how but, apparently, I was the smart kid in my â€¦. no wait, it was basically everywhere.
