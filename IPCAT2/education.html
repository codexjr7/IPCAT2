                        <p>As I had mentioned earlier, I happened to be a really sharp one. But like every child my first school was home and my first parents were my very diligent parents. Instilling values and principles is something they did with precision and wisdom and I appreciate.<br> 
                            As I got into pre school it was fun after the first day as I thought they were snatching my mom away from me. It got better when I realized she would be coming for me every evening, phew! So everyday was like a play meet with my new friends who I may or may not have had to make understand that they didn’t have to cry every time their moms and dads left. That is until I realized …<br>
                            School was like work! ‘Proposturous! ( is a word I learnt in primary school under Mrs. Ondego, my teacher of English). Anywho I still had to do my due part to keep my grades up and that is what I did. There I fell in love with the computers in the computer lab. A couple of years in primary school polished the rough edges and sharpened the senses to be able to take on highschool on a high note. I went to a national school.<br>
                            Our school motto was ‘Perseverance shall win through’ so you can imagine. My school was one of the best in the country. I developed an interest in Biology under Mr. Agwa and Geography under Mr. Julius, but I still loved computers but they kept on switching teachers so I didn’t have a specific as they were all good. Math, every student’s nightmare was our school subject, so we had no choice but to excel in it and thanks to the amazing teachers like Mr. Ochieng, the human calculator. I exceled here too and got into Zetech University where I am currently…<br>
                            I have to say, I love liberty and with comes responsibility, which I am so lucky was imparted well in me. It has been a whole experience since I joined, I met new friends, I met my little wolf, studying is so much easier with a lot of resources at my disposal. I have met pretty interesting lecturersand I cant wait for graduation day…
