                    <p>My greatest/biggest/ardent desire and meaning to life is having my own family, a happy, peaceful and cohesive family for that matter. A prayerful and strong family, my little wolf and I, “As for me and my family, we shall serve the Lord”. I will give them the life that I desired and so much coveted. They will be my greatest accomplishment. That would be the greatest blessing and act of grace from God.<br>
                        <br>

                        Career wise I chose to do what I love and therefore, as a software developer in the making, I look forward to having my own tech company. And I can see business booming and it becoming a big thing, which would mean a whole lot of benjamins. Every day is another day closer to this vision, actualizing this ambition of ours.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        
                        
                        From this success, I will build our very big luxurious house, if there’ll be any land left to build on that is since the real estate industry is booming and if not, I’d have no choice but to buy a very big luxurious house. Home will be HOME, lots of love, lots of space, lots of food, lots of everything.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                         I will get my first car, which FYI must be a Mercedes benz E-W214 , one for me and for my little wolf and then we can start thinking of adding others. And for pets I will have my two Dobermans, very vicious, just how I like and two fur babies as well as house pets.<br>

                        I have confidence in my vision and it shall indeed come true, I may not know what tomorrow holds but I have an assurance in who holds tomorrow, and that is enough for me. Luke 1:37.
